    My approach to designing software thus far is trying to learn and be able to apply all the skills being taught. I don't typically try to get too creative just yet even though I want too. 
    
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
	The new design skills I have learned while working on my project is the use of opengl and dealing with shapes and manipulating size, texture, lighting, and position. 
 
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
	For my project I took a image given in the prvious section and built my program to imulate the same picture but in a 3D model. For this I created little by little for each milestone eventually recreating the image in the end.
 
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
	In the future I think I will take very similar steps I took this time. I didn't run into alot of issues aside for adjusting lighting. 
 
    How do I approach developing programs?
    Firstly with a prgram like this my approach was more along the lines of  seeing an image and then looking at all the shapes it will require to recreate the image. I like more upfront planning and establishing milestones.
    
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
	I used applying texture, color, and lighting. I also learned how to scale and manipulate shapes to recreate objects.
 
        How did iteration factor into your development?
	iteration helped me break my development into sections and allowed me to focus on that specific part of my program. 
 
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
	My project evolved and became more realistic after each milestone the first milestone I was able to essentially set up my scene and objects within it so I have a scene of nothing but colorful shapes, then
 	after that I added texture to my objects, then lighting and eventually it all came together with minor adjustments here and there. 
  
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    Computer science can give me the knowledge to understand some of the programs I will be working on in the future. Also how to work on them.
    
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
	My goal is to get into a government contracting position that will allow me to create virtual simulation programs for the US military. visualization and graphics is 
 	important when considering realistic scenarios and simulations.
